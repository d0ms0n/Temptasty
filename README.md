# Temptasty - temperature measurements

This repository includes a demo implementation of a fictional IOT scenario,
where sensors take temperature readings and send them to a backend.

Used technologies are:

- influxdb 2.0
- quarkus 3.0.1
- angular 15.2.7
- nginx 1.23.3

# Component overview

![component model](http://www.plantuml.com/plantuml/proxy?cache=no&src=https://raw.github.com/d0ms0n/Temptasty/master/components.iuml)

## Sensor

Then mock sensor is an Alpine Linux docker image with a bash script, which emits randomized numbers between 10 and 300.
This numbers, embedded in a json format, will be sent to a receiver url, or otherwise prints the json to stdout.

You can configure the script via environment variables. Possibilities are:

- RECEIVER_URL=https://temptasty.org:8081/measurements
- SLEEP_TIME=5

The format looks like:

```
{
    "name": "sensor1",
    "unit": "celsius",
    "time": "2023-05-11T14:34:17Z",
    "value": 66.72
}
```

## Frontend
The frontend component is an angular app. The chart libraries are chart.js and ng2-charts. Learn more about angular [here](https://angular.io/).

To show the frontend, go to https://temptasty.org:8081/measurement-viewer

## Backend
The backend component is a quarkus application. Lern more about quarkus [here](https://quarkus.io/).

```
# get all measurements
curl -i -X GET 'https://temptasty.org:8081/measurements'

# get mean within a range of the last hour (h) day (d) month (m)
# filter with query parameter "sensor"
curl -i -X GET 'https://temptasty.org:8081/measurements/mean?sensor=sensor1&range=h'
```

To view the openapi description go to http://localhost:8080/q/swagger-ui/

## Database
The database is an influxdb docker image. 
Learn more about influx [here](https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v2.7/).

To configure the database, go to http://localhost:8086/

# Running the application

You must provide an .env file in root folder with following content

```
# InfluxDB Configuration
INFLUXDB_INIT_USERNAME=admin
INFLUXDB_INIT_PASSWORD=password
INFLUXDB_INIT_ADMIN_TOKEN=mytoken
```

Also modify your hosts file to support temptasty.org

```
127.0.0.1 temptasty.org
```

You also have to create a ssl certificate with private key, store it under reverse-proxy/certs
and put them to the nginx configuration.

To build and run the application, be sure to have npx, docker and docker-compose installed.
From root folder, call

```
./run.sh
```
